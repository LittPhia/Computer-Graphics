# More Lights
With a great investment of efforts, I finally clamped onto this stage. This would be the last project that I created by following the website [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl-cn.github.io) for this semaster. I have been losing on my "formal" lessons for such a long time, yet I can not keep losing, em?

Doing this is actually funny --- and I love it. Remembered in Project1, debuging costs no time because I just copied the codes, without understanding. One project after one project, gradually I got used to how OpenGL works (in core mode), and proficiency in GLSL was getting better. At now I am much much more capable of this grahics library than the beginning, with much much more complicated codes and mutiple times on debuging, althought most of the errors are caused by stupied operation. By the way, COPY_AND_PASTE_THEN_AJUST could product ten trucks of hidden bugs.

In some aspects, I know myself too well. When the last bug was killed and this was showed on the screen:

You know after being throught some horrible hours, the world shall be eventually lighted up.
